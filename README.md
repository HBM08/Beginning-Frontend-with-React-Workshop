# WIP - Beginning Frontend with React Workshop - WIP

Hands-on React workshop going through the basic principles of the React library. We will go through a few basic topics in the React library
- Virtual DOM
- Components (Stateful, Stateless, HOC)
- Rendering
- State
- Props
- JSX
- Asynchronous setState
- Component Life Cycle

## Goal
Creating a list component that gets data from a random API and displays and filters that data.

## Prerequisites 
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) -> Download and install LTS version
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Run "npm install -g create-react-app" in any CLI

## How to follow along
Workshop is divided in multiple parts
1) Starting a new React Project
2) Creating a Stateful Component
3) Adding Filtering
4) Linking to a live API
5) Final Result

Each folder has an associated README.md file with instructions for that specific checkpoint. I will go briefly on what we will going to go through

### 1) Starting a new React Project
Contains an empty folder where we will start the workshop.
We will create the structure of the project and also create our first few components.
Also, here we will create our first proper list item component.

### 2) Creating a Stateful Component
Contains the result of the previous folder which should contain the structure created and our list item component. Also contains some mock data in a static JSON file.
The purpose of this checkpoint is creating our first stateful component and understanding the difference between it and our stateless one. 
Basically, we will create our list wrap component which controls the state of our list

### 3) Adding Filtering
This checkpoint builds upon the previous one adding some filtering components and seeing how our stateless components work together
We will create a search component and a radio button component


### 4) Linking to a live API
We will go through the process of linking to an async API
Will also go into HOC and how they can come into play to solve some issues that arise.

### 5) Final Result
Will contain the final result of what was presented.
This is just one possible solution, it can be implemented in a lot of different ways.
